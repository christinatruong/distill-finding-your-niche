					<h1>1979 - 1984</h1>
					<img src="img/christina-truong-toddler.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						I remember being excited to start kindergarten, excited to embark on a new adventure. I actually remember saying, “I can’t believe I’m going to school tomorrow!
						<br><br>
						But It didn't turn out quite as expected. 
						<br><br>
						I grew up in a community that was mostly White so going to school was the first time I experienced what it was like to be different. I don't have any stories of being shoved into lockers or being pushed down on the playground. My story is not one of being bullied, it is one of being "othered". The kids would ask me why my skin was yellow, why my nose was so flat. They made ching chong jokes and stretch their eyes… <br><br>

						But I think the most puzzling question came after asking me "what are you?" When I told them I was Vietnamese, they would ask about "the war.” This was ’84, what were their parents talking about at home to make this a 5 year old's recess conversation?<br><br>

						I'm sure these questions were asked out of curiosity and they just didn’t know any better from limited experience with people that looked like me or just different from what they were used to. But at 5, I didn't understand this. I just knew that the exclusion left me feeling like there was something wrong with me and that I needed to be like everybody else if I wanted to be liked.<br><br>

						So, I stopped speaking Vietnamese at home. I started lying and telling people I was Chinese to avoid the whole "war talk." I tried to emulated my classmates. I wanted to wear the clothes they wore, I wanted to talk the way they talked. I wanted to eat peanut butter & jelly sandwiches. I pretended to like the things they liked, even if I didn't know what it was!

					<h1>1992-1994</h1>					
					<img src="img/christina-truong-teen.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						I really tried to fit in but around the age of 12-13, I came to the realization that my efforts were being wasted. It didn't matter what I did, I just couldn't be something I wasn't. I still felt like I was on the outside looking in but I started to at least be comfortable with the idea of just trying to be myself, even if that meant getting made fun of, even if that meant being left out, even if that meant being different.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>					
					<h1>1996-2001</h1>
					<img src="img/cities-collage.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						Around this time I was getting into the internets and going to chat rooms where I got to meet people from all over. People that felt like me. Even though I had friends, there was still a part of me that didn't feel totally at ease. I still had to pretend sometimes.  After I graduated high school, I took a 3 week trip to NY.  I even met one of my chat room buddies. This experience totally opened up my eyes to a whole new world. It confirmed that there were people out there, like me.<br><br>

						When I was 20, I decided to finally leave my home town and move to San Jose, CA for university and then ended up in Toronto a year later (those international student fees were no joke). During my university years, I not only made a lot of new friends, I finally had a "crew," finally felt like I really belonged somewhere.  I didn't have to pretend anymore.

					<h1>WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH TECH?</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						For me, navigating through the tech world sometimes makes me feel like that young girl again. Trying to fit in or feeling like there was something wrong with me because I wasn’t like everybody else.<br><br>

I graduated university with a degree in Comm & Psych and about a year later I enrolled in a 14 week Web Design college program. I had always been interested in computers and drawing so for me this seemed perfect combination. I could take a blank HTML page and turn it into anything, it was pretty amazing! <br><br>

My class was small, around 20 people and had a mix of gender and ethnicities. But I wasn't conscious of that at the time b/c it was what I had become accustomed to living in Toronto.  I didn't think about tech culture when I was in school either.  I was just excited about learning and trying to master my newly acquired skills.<br><br>

When I started working, I didn't know that being a female developer was considered unusual. In my first job, there were plenty of other women in tech roles. But as I began to move around to different jobs, I started to hear comments like "wow, girl dev!" or "you're not like other developers!" These comments didn't bother me at the time because I didn't feel like people were saying it to be negative, they were just surprised.  But it did make me realize that my previous experiences was not usual for other women in this field.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>					
					<h1>WOW! GIRL DEV?!</h1>
 					<img src="img/christina-bw.jpg">
					Blog Post - <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/thats-what-she-said-thoughts-from-a-female-dev/">That’s what she said: thoughts from a female dev</a> 
					<aside class="notes">
						I eventually joined a company where not only was I the only female developer (at the time), I was also the first to ever be hired.  Apparently only one other woman had ever applied before me. So, I decided to write a blog post about being a female developer.  While I was do research, I stumbled onto some really disturbing stories about the rampant sexism in the industry and was and still am surprised at how hostile the environment can be for women. <br><br>

Knowing that this kind of negativity exists, I sometimes feel reluctant to be more vocal because I don’t want to put myself out there and experience that level of hostility and I can see this being a deterrent for others as well.<br><br>

Luckily for me, the worst I've had to deal with is the condescending tone or arrogance from those offering "helpful hints," especially when I started teaching and moving into more senior roles.

Though the number of females in tech are low, there were often other women around in non-tech roles as well so, for me personally, I feel the lack of ethnic diversity affects me more, especially as I started to move towards digital agencies & startup type environments, where the numbers seemed to dwindle even more. <br><br>

I’m not saying that being a woman in tech doesn’t come with it’s own issues, I just want to shed light on a topic that not only affects me personally, but doesn’t seem to get talked about as often.<br><br>

					<aside class="notes">
[refer to diagram] This is the breakdown of the % of people who identify themselves as visible minorities in Toronto.  explain diagram<br><br>

I don't have the numbers for Toronto tech companies but I can say that I’m fairly certain it's not this. The Toronto tech community feels pretty close to the numbers that many of the major tech companies have released in the last couple of months.<br><br>

This lack of diversity in the workplace and the tech community was quite a bit of a culture shock for me. What happened to the Toronto I had become so used to? Was I still in the same city? It was so different from my personal life.<br><br>

I started to notice that in subtle ways, I had fallen into old habits. I started to be more conscious of the way I looked and dressed, the things I was interested (or not interested in), the way I talked or the things I’d say and just like my days in the schoolyard, I felt different.  <br><br>

I wasn't as outgoing or talkative. I felt out of place, like I couldn’t be myself. <br><br>

There were times when I thought about leaving the industry and doing something else. Especially when I met other women and minorities that seemed to blend in so seamlessly. <br><br>

Was there something wrong with me? Am I just being difficult?<br><br>


How many of you are familiar with the term “code-switching?”  It basically means changing the way you speak or act based on who you are interacting with. For example, the way you talk to your boss is probably different than the way you talk to your parents or to your friends.

					<aside class="notes">
						It’s not that I didn’t get along with most of the people I worked with.  In fact, some of my best friends are people in tech :)<br><br>

But sometimes, feeling like I was on permanent code-switch could get very tiring.<br><br>

So I figured, this is just life.  Work is work. That's why everybody looks forward to the weekend right?  As long as I actually enjoyed the work itself, I was one of the lucky ones. The rest didn’t matter.  At least that was how I tried to convince myself.

						(A List Apart explores the design, development, and meaning of web content, with a special focus on web standards and best practices)<br><br>

From 2007-2011, A List Apart had been conducting surveys about web professionals. They not only covered demographics such as gender and ethnicity, but also information about education, salary, job titles, and a lot more.  Let’s look at the diversity stats. 	(Gender first)

						It looks like a whole lotta nothing has changed except the numbers of Asians in the industry is significantly higher. The ALA survey included people from all over the world with the majority of respondents from the US and Europe whereas the numbers from the tech companies focus on only the US so we can’t do a straight comparison but it’s interesting to note how the % of other groups are pretty much the same.<br><br>

It's great that the companies have committed to being transparent and are posting these results publicly but through the years, didn’t anybody ever just look around and realized they needed to make a change???

					<h1>DIVERSITY ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE NUMBERS</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						The numbers only tell one part of the story. Of the different minority groups, women & Asians are represented in higher numbers than any other group.  Asians are actually overrepresented in some cases. I’m an Asian female, I should be happy because I’m winning here right?<br><br>

I'm not going to celebrate this as a win because I think these numbers are telling a different story.

					<h2>DIFFERENT MARGINALIZED GROUPS EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DISCRIMINATION</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						[Different marginalized groups experience different kinds of discrimination] so I'm not at all surprised by these numbers.<br><br>

Asian people, historically, have been stereotyped as being smart, hardworking and “model minorities.” 
Though being smart and hardworking are generally good qualities to have, any biases, even if they seem to be positive, still creates an uneven playing field.<br><br>

And even though the industry is dominated by men, there are still significantly more White women than black or hispanic men.  <br><br>

So it is real diversity if the few that are allowed in are the ones that may be perceived as more likely to fit in with the existing culture or least likely to disrupt the status quo?<br><br>

I'm not saying that people are actively and consciously saying "let's hire white women and asians because they're nicer." But in our quest for political correctness and the belief that we live in a post-racial society, we may often overlook the more subtle forms of biased behaviour.<br><br>

For example, there have been countless studies showing how something as simple as a name on a resume can bias the person reviewing them, therefore significantly affecting an applicant's chances of getting a callback. <br><br>

let's face it, it's much harder to talk about race than gender but we have to be willing to confront our own biases rather than ignoring it or explaining it away. <br><br>

What these tech companies are doing by publishing their diversity stats and making public commitments to change helps to bring awareness and start the conversation. But much of the efforts and initiatives are focused on recruiting or provide education for those who won’t be joining the workforce any time soon.  Which is great but ...what about the people that are already here?

					<h1>Culture</h1>
					<p><img src="img/silicon-valley-cast.jpg" alt="">
					<a href="http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley">HBO's Silicon Valley</a></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						These feelings of exclusion don’t always come just from being in the minority in terms of gender or race.<br><br>

There's a certain culture, representation and expectation of what a developer or programmer is supposed to look like, be like, act like and aspire to be. 
<br><br>
I wrote a piece about this as sort of a pre-cursor to this presentation and I talked about how the #iamdoingprogramming trend had the opposite effect for me in the sense that it made me feel more excluded when it was started as a response to a display of sexism in the industry.  I didn’t get half of the puns & jokes and the other half just wasn't funny to me. I couldn’t see myself, I couldn’t relate to my peers, male or female.<br><br>

Just because I don’t think certain things are funny or are not relatable to me, it doesn’t mean that I have a problem with the culture *itself* per se. My problem is it feels very one dimensional and doesn’t leave much room for other representations.<br><br>

If those who are *in* the culture can't even see themselves, how can others see themselves becoming a part of this?

					<h1>YOU'RE NOT A "REAL" DEVELOPER</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						There’s the physical representations but there’s also the “OH MY GOD, YOU DON’T USE GRUNT?”  Or on the flipside, “YOU’RE STILL USING GRUNT. DON’T YOU KNOW ABOUT GULP?”  Or you ask a question and the answer is “Why would you want to do that?” <br><br>

I’m not opposed to keeping up with the latest and greatest and I’m open to learning new things from my peers.  It’s the “you’re not a real developer if you don’t do xyz” sentiments that’s alienating and just plain annoying. This feels like another way of saying “You’re not like me, you're not like us.” <br><br>

Also, there’s a difference between sharing knowledge and just trying to show how clever you are. <br><br>

I enjoy teaching b/c students ask me things I don't think of b/c I'm used to doing things a certain way so I often learn something new from them too. And I'm careful about not presenting my opinions as fact. <br><br>

Sharing and learning from each other helps to create community so we need to keep in mind that we need people to feel comfortable asking questions and sharing their ideas.

					<h1>CULTURE FIT</h1> 
					<h1>!= </h1>
					<h1>BEING BFFS</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						Culture fit is important.  It makes sense to try to find people that will get along and work well together for 40hrs+ a week.  But culture fit doesn’t mean hiring people you want to be friends with. Working well together and being buddies is not the same thing. Especially since the industry is already dominated by factors such as race and culture, leaning on “cultural fit = people like us” can lead to continued dominance in the industry.
<br><br>
* Dominance in a group creates a 1 dimensional culture. Because of this, it may bias those in power and in the community about who gets invited in.
* it can also make those in the minority feel like have to be like everyone else to be successful 
* jobs are often from
 referrals and who you know so if the pool of applicants reflect that dominant group, the the same kinds of people are getting hired over and over again.

					<h1>DIVERSITY</h1>
					<ol>
					<li>the state or fact of being<br>diverse; difference; unlikeness.</li>
					<li>variety; multiformity.</li>
					<li>a point of difference.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com">dictionary.reference.com</a></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Diversity means actually having people who are DIFFERENT.  People who look different. People with different opinions, personalities, backgrounds, ages, interests and different point of views. 
<br><br>
Yes, this may lead to disagreements and “conflicts” but we need these different perspectives to foster creativity and growth.  

<br><br>
Technology has become such a large part of all kinds of peoples lives. Shouldn't the people involved in creating it be representative of the people using it?

					</aside>

				<section>					
					<h1>SOLUTIONS?</h1>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment">Speak up, be heard - for yourself and for others</li>
						<li class="fragment">listen to what others have to say</li>
						<li class="fragment">welcome and embrace differences</li>
						<li class="fragment">just be you</li>
					</ol>

					<aside class="notes">
						So I’ve talk a lot about the problem.  I should probably offer a solution, right?  
Well… I’m not sure if I really have one. I think we’re still stuck at trying to figure out what the problem is!
<br><br>
But the least I can do right now and what you can do right now is:
a) speak up and be heard - not only for yourself but for others who don’t feel they have a voice in this community just yet.
b} Listen. - It’s really frustrating when you try to tell someone you feel something and they tell you you’re just imagining it. acknowledge what people are telling you.
c) just be you - don’t change who you are, don’t change what makes you unique
d) Welcome and celebrate differences
<br><br>
Over the years, I’ve been that person that didn't want to rock the boat. I've fallen into the pattern of trying to make myself less different, not talking about certain things, not speaking up when offended. But at the end of the day, I can't be happy or successful based on someone else’s standards or expectations. And though I’ve fallen into these patterns, I always come back to the realization that this is my life and only I can decide how I want to live it.  
<br><br>
Though I’ve talked a lot about exclusion, I have managed to find my place in this community by continuing to define success, on my own terms and reminding myself to just be myself!
